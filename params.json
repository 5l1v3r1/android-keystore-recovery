{"body":"## Android Keystore Recovery\r\n\r\nThis project aims to solve the \"password forgotten\" problem for (Android) developers who happen to manage java keystore(s).\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n> Note that it is still a development version, some fixes still need be done\r\n\r\nThis bruteforce tool is very simple, yet efficient. It will try all password combinations matching `[A-Za-z0-9]+`, from the shortest password, up to the solution.\r\n\r\nThere are currently three options:\r\n\r\n* `-l <minLength>` sets a minimum length for the password, if you know that it should have at least n characters (can save a lot of time)\r\n* `-f <fromPsswd>` sets the combination from which the brute force should start\r\n* `-t <toPasswd>` sets the last combination that sould be tested\r\n\r\n> Note: If you want to resume a stopped brute force, I suggest that you take the second last tried password that was stored in `$HOME/AndroidKeystoreRecovery.log`. Indeed, as actor computation is asynchronous, there is no guarantee that every password before the last one were _really_ tried by the software.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n1. Download the [project jar](http://download.bluepyth.fr/releases/akr-1.0.0.jar)\r\n2. Extract it where you feel like\r\n3. Launch the bruteforce search thanks to this command : `java -jar akr-1.0.0.jar <keystore> [opts]`\r\n\r\n## Technical Information\r\n\r\nThis software runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), so you need to have a Java Runtime Environnement (JRE) installed on your computer. If you don't have one, get it at http://java.com.\r\n\r\nTo benefit from multi-core computers, this software uses the awesome [Akka](http://akka.io) actor library.\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\n* __Pull Requests__: I accept every meaningful pull request that you might offer. Please add description and comments in the code :)\r\n* __Issues__: You can create issues, however, I don't know when I'll have time to fix them (will do my best!)\r\n\r\n## Licence\r\n\r\nCopyright Romain Sertelon 2013\r\n\r\nThis software is licenced under the GNU Public Licence v3 (GPLv3), you can find it in the `LICENCE` file.","note":"Don't delete this file!
