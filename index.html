        <h2>Android Keystore Recovery</h2>

<p>This project aims to solve the "password forgotten" problem for (Android) developers who happen to manage java keystore(s).</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>This bruteforce tool is very simple, yet efficient. It will try all password combinations matching <code>[A-Za-z0-9]+</code>, from the shortest password, up to the solution.</p>

<p>There are currently three options:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>-l &lt;minLength&gt;</code> sets a minimum length for the password, if you know that it should have at least n characters (can save a lot of time)</li>
<li>
<code>-f &lt;fromPsswd&gt;</code> sets the combination from which the brute force should start</li>
<li>
<code>-t &lt;toPasswd&gt;</code> sets the last combination that sould be tested</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p>Note: If you want to resume a stopped brute force, I suggest that you take the second last tried password that was stored in <code>$HOME/AndroidKeystoreRecovery.log</code>. Indeed, as actor computation is asynchronous, there is no guarantee that every password before the last one were <em>really</em> tried by the software.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<ol>
<li>Download the <a href="http://download.bluepyth.fr/releases/">project jar</a>
</li>
<li>Launch the bruteforce: <code>java -jar akr-1.0.1.jar &lt;keystore&gt; [opts]</code>
</li>
</ol><h2>Time needed to retrieve password</h2>

<p>Bruteforce algorithms are not optimized at all, AKR is faster than other bruteforce tools but it will still try <strong>all</strong> password possibilities.</p>

<p>In our case, we try all the characters like so: <code>A, B, ..., Z, a, b, ..., z, 0, ..., 9</code>. This is 62 possibilites for one character of the password.</p>

<p>Depending on your hardware, AKR will try more or less passwords per second, this is a sample calculation with my own computer:</p>

<pre><code>- AKR velocity: v = 120 000 passwords/seconds
- Number of combinations for a password of length n: 62^n
- Number of combinations for a 6 characters password: 56 800 235 584
- Time needed to try all these combinations: 56 800 235 584 / v = 5.5 days!
- Time needed for 7 character passwords: 5.5 * 62 = 339 days!
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, brute force with a single computer can take a very long time...</p>

<p>You can use the <code>-f (--from)</code> and <code>-t (--to)</code> options to run AKR on different computers, to parallelize computation and try to shorten the discovery of the password.</p>

<h2>Technical Information</h2>

<p>This software runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), so you need to have a Java Runtime Environnement (JRE) installed on your computer. If you don't have one, get it at <a href="http://java.com">http://java.com</a>.</p>

<p>To benefit from multi-core computers, this software uses the awesome <a href="http://akka.io">Akka</a> actor library.</p>
