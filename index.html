        <h2>Android Keystore Recovery</h2>

<p>This project aims to solve the "password forgotten" problem for (Android) developers who happen to manage java keystore(s).</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Note that it is still a development version, some fixes still need be done</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This bruteforce tool is very simple, yet efficient. It will try all password combinations matching <code>[A-Za-z0-9]+</code>, from the shortest password, up to the solution.</p>

<p>There are currently two options:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>-l &lt;minLength&gt;</code> sets a minimum length for the password, if you know that it should have at least n characters (can save a lot of time)</li>
<li>
<code>-s &lt;fromPsswd&gt;</code> sets the combination from which the brute force should start (useful to resume a brute force search)</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p>Note: If you want to resume a stopped brute force, I suggest that you take the second last tried password that was stored in <code>$HOME/AndroidKeystoreRecovery.log</code>. Indeed, as actor computation is asynchronous, there is no guarantee that every password before the last one were <em>really</em> tried by the software.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<ol>
<li>Download the project tarball (link to come...)</li>
<li>Extract it where you feel like</li>
<li>Launch the bruteforce search thanks to this command : <code>java -jar android-keystore-recovery.jar &lt;keystore&gt; [opts]</code>
</li>
</ol><h2>Technical Information</h2>

<p>This software runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), so you need to have a Java Runtime Environnement (JRE) installed on your computer. If you don't have one, get it at <a href="http://java.com">http://java.com</a>.</p>

<p>To benefit from multi-core computers, this software uses the awesome <a href="http://akka.io">Akka</a> actor library.</p>
